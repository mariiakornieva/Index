## Metaeducation Global Initiative

Earth, 2021, education system does not exist, islands of enlightenment are kept around
single enthusiastic educators, while the accessibility of knowledge has reached its
maximum in the entire history of mankind.

Traditional schools and universities are a cargo cult and an imitation of education, hidden behind
formal procedures and existing only by inertia (except for rare
non-systematic exceptions). In these conditions, we, professionals of different areas,
know how to reproduce thinking, culture, art, science and
technology, we take responsibility for preparing future generations, not
only our children, with whom we definitely start, but also everyone who wants to
join the Metaeducation Global Initiative.

We put studying and work together into one process, different generations into one team,
we set interesting and ambitious tasks for the team, and we lead along the way of solving
engineering issues. So that in the process of solving them people would make theoretical
generalizations tied to practice and personal thought experience. This way a theory won't be
forgotten and redundant. However, it's important to start with examples of the reasoning of
comrades, observe their successes, and be inspired by their results, so that
you would get a desire to help, and then benefit the community and demonstrate
your skills.

The word "Meta" means that we will learn ourselves, and we will teach those who teach. Greek
word "τέχνη" [tékhnē] can be perceived as related to technology, but the meaning of it is art.
We believe that both STEM and social sciences must be taught hand in hand and cannot be
mastered separately. We do not separate theory and practice, learning and application,
student and teacher. The entire process is built upon a really useful project,
which involves people of all ages and specialties. We want to move away from an artificial
environment where you can only learn how to solve educational problems through tutorials.
Our goal is to learn through experience and observation of how others are gaining that
experience. We do not oversimplify or distort knowledge, making it easier to understand
for beginners, we remember that retraining is more difficult than mastering the skill right away.
You are going to be immediately presented with a very challenging task, where
everyone will find their role. Someone will start solving it, while someone else
will look at how others approach the problem and their decision-making process and reasoning.
The depth of comprehension may be delayed, but the reality and complexity of the present task cannot be postponed.

The foundation is a passion for our profession, thirst for knowledge, and love for
manifestations of human talent. We form a distributed system in different
countries that works according to common principles. Students of any age and
their parents can unite anywhere and launch the department of Metaeducation.

We assume that the parents themselves will take an active part in the education of their children,
and also invite specialists occasionally. We abandon obsolete concepts of
education, such as class and group, year of study, semester and
quarter, subject, course, and credit. Education should be permanent and
seamless, from birth to death, without formal division into preschool,
school, higher and postgraduate. Everyone moves at their own pace, and, together with
teachers, chooses only what is of their interest, forms a map and
a detailed plan of knowledge acquisition, where each topic is recorded
independently and there is an external evaluation. For example, this map can include topics such as
"Arithmetic division" and "Color wheel", "PID controller", "Correspondence
of the kings of the ancient world ”, “Lambda-cube”, “Invitation to execution”, “Removal of the invariant
cycle”, “The Tower of the Yellow Crane”, etc. 
Topics, of course, are built into the system, they
form a tree with cross-references (in fact, a graph of links), according to which
the student can navigate a route to form their unique profession. Hints on
which topic to choose can be suggested by teachers or by algorithms and models of machine
training that we will develop. The level of understanding of each topic may have
layers from “familiar” to “taught a peer" and even “made a scientific contribution”.

Trust in this system will be formed from professional trust in
teachers, who develop the program and conduct lectures and seminars, from
trust in parents, who organize daily discussion, practice, and joint
projects, out of trust in professionals in different fields, which we will
invite regularly to talk about their work, why their work is crucial
and why it might be interesting to others. Supervision of professionals,
passionate about their work and gradual involvement in productive work -
the basis of our approach, which gives both motivation and an interesting process, and a useful
result.

The economic model of Metaeducation: the organization is non-profit, the whole
payment is spent on mentoring, business expenses, and necessary
materials. Methodical recommendations, video lectures, and texts are prepared and
posted free of charge for everyone in the public domain with the obligatory
discussion in a professional environment. Copyright for all materials
governed by the free licenses Creative Commons and MIT.

Part of the practice will be collecting and organizing project information. Thousands of 
sources of literature have become available to us in a digital form, as well as audio/video lectures
from all over the world and in a variety of languages, digital treasures of different
cultures and civilizations, but only a few find it valuable and useful. Communication
and multimedia capabilities available in any phone are more powerful than
computers from the recent past, cloud technologies, and neural networks,
are not used to access knowledge or to create new knowledge, but for aimless
waste of time and escape from the sense of meaninglessness existence.
One of the projects in the educational centers of Metarhia will be the creation of
information systems for the educational process itself, as well as for automation of
information processing in the field of medicine, production, transportation, communication and
other areas.

We admit that learning might involve mistakes and dead-end branches of knowledge because forgotten
misconceptions are repeated quickly. Knowledge does not live in letters, but in constant
rethinking and reproducing of it, and frozen words lose or change their
meaning.

We do not focus on the market value of the knowledge gained or on the prospects of
admission to universities.  We do not seek to prepare you for interviews for
a highly paid position, but we are guided by the benefits that can bring
our students to their loved ones, the community, and all of humanity. Together with you, we
will create a new type of production and a new form of economy based on knowledge
and public benefit, not added value. Modern education - is a falsification of a person
and a reproduction of bureaucratic ceremonies,
rewriting notes, memorizing without understanding, testing determining
only the ability to pass testing is what we are offered
nation-states. Modern employers are the majority of companies
offering such enticing conditions for beginners - these are places of voluntary
alienation of the results of your work and complete personal degradation. You can
feel it by your example, but it is better not to waste years of your life and
organize community enterprises with other students, this will
and more profitable and more interesting, but requires high responsibility and
involvement in the overall result. You choose whether to be a cog in the mechanism
market or an equal partner in a team of like-minded people.

Мы не ориентируемся на рыночную ценность полученных знаний или на перспективы
поступления в ВУЗы, не стремимся подготовить вас к собеседованиям на
высокооплачиваемую должность, а руководствуемся пользой, которую смогут принести
наши ученики своим близким, сообществу и всему человечеству. Вместе с вами мы
создадим новый тип производства и новую форму экономики, построенную на знаниях
и общественной пользе, а не на добавленной стоимости. Современное образование -
это фальсификация человека и воспроизведение бюрократических церемоний,
переписывание конспектов, зазубривание без понимания, тестирование, определяющее
только способность к прохождению тестирования - вот, что нам предлагают
национальные государства. Современные работодатели - большинство компаний,
предлагающих такие заманчивые для начинающих условия - это места добровольного
отчуждения результатов вашего труда и полной личностной деградации. Вы можете
ощутить это на собственном примере, но лучше не терять годы своей жизни и
организовывать общественные предприятия вместе с другими учащимися, это и будет
и более выгодно и более интересно, но требует высокой ответственности и
вовлеченности в общий результат. Вы выбираете, быть ли винтиком в механизме
рынка или равным партнером в коллективе единомышленников.
